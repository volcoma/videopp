	<p>Once upon a time in a blueberry bubblegum land covered in pink violets that swayed to the rhythm of "My Baby Just Cares for Me" there lived a podgy yet attractive raspberry fairy called Bedooda. Bedooda was as tall as a button bush and as intelligent as a peach mystic from the Unscented Hills (not the Scented Hills - the mystics there were not too bright) and was an adored member of the raspberry family but she was an unhappy raspberry fairy. As unhappy as a lost sunfish from the Sweet Spaghetti River.</p>
