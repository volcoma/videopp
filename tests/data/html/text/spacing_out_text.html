	<p id="p5">Even leaving aside the astounding nutritional package, the taste explosion and texture of a well cooked pea is undeniably enough to award this deceptively simple seed the gold-medal of the foodstuff Olympics.</p>
	<p id="p6">There is debate surrounding the tampering of the form of the original spherical vegetable. The question as to whether the 'mushy' pea is sacrilege or an innovative approach to re-package the perfect product is a sensitive issue. A similar argument arises when approaching the relatively new craze of mangetout. In-depth study is required, but for now it is too early to assess the true importance of this baby pea pod.</p>
