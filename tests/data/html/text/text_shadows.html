	<h1>A little tale accompanied by a little text shadow</h1>
	<p>In Botswana's Chobe National Park, <em id="elephant">an elephant with an especially large trunk</em> is minding its own business when <em id="plesiosaur">a plesiosaur with five heads, two tails, and the legs of a lion</em> falls out of the sky and lands on the elephant's back.</p>
	<p>"Hah hah! That's hilarious!", says the plesiosaur, "Your trunk is huge!"</p>
	<p><em id="tourist">A stunned tourist in a nearby Jeep</em> drops his camera, stares in amazement, and excitedly taps his wife on the shoulder.</p>
	<p>"Look, honey! That's amazing! The talking prehistoric marine reptile with five heads, two tails, and the legs of a lion that fell out of the sky is right! That elephant's trunk is ginormous!"</p>
